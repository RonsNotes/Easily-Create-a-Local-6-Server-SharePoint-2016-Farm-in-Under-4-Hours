# Easily-Create-a-Local-6-Server-SharePoint-2016-Farm-in-Under-4-Hours
PowerShell scripts 
This guide targets three audiences. The first want to use PowerShell to "get the farm built fast". The second wants step-by-step with screenshots and the GUI to get a better understanding of the process. The third wants a mix. We cover all three groups by producing both the PowerShell guide and the GUI guide then hyperlinking the sections so you can jump between them. 
We further have guides for a three-server farm, Domain Controller, SQL Server and SharePoint and a single all-in-one server. Each configuration uses Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machines. 
Our design goals assume a minimum of technical skills. With PowerShell, it is mostly right-click and Run. 
You do need Windows 7.1 or above and 16G bytes of memory for the six-server farm. The three servers will operate on 6GB and the single on 4gb.
